### Requirements:
#### I was asked to develop a single web page application with a two dimensional game built in. Using:
  * CSS
  * HTML
  * JavaScript ( I decided to also use the P5 library )
 
### What I decided to make: 
#### My current plan for my project is to design a simple but intuitive lockdown simulator, in
which you must balance work, sleep, hunger and thirst while also completing puzzles to
unravel an interesting story.
I plan to target this game mostly towards university students that have spent a considerable
amount of time in lockdown, shedding light on a few of the struggles that often went
undervalued. Ideally my game provides a different perspective on the pandemic, potentially
attracting other demographics. The issue I hope to target with this web application is the
huge decline in mental health across university students during this global pandemic. My
game should highlight why exactly the social isolation can be so difficult on certain students
and hopefully encourage small but impactful acts of kindness, by magnifying the effects they
can have.
I have decided to name the game “Isolated”, due it being short and catchy but also clearly
showcasing the atmosphere of the game. It is vital to me that the web application is simple
and intuitive for the user to play, from movement to completing puzzles should all act to
improve the story not hinder it.
